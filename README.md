## Design Process
- This app was meant for users who want to not only keep track of their good habits but also damaging/bad ones such as binging netflix.
- The design and colourscheme of this app was such that it was friendly in terms of mood and also feel. Main colour yellow and rounded rectangles help to soften the seriousness when a user sometimes feel stressed from struggling with their habits
- As a user, I want to have a simplistic, least number of pages app such that there are lesser things to play around with and more time to focus on the more important things 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Login form:
    1. Open up the app through index.html
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid username or password and verify that an error message about wrong username or password appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
2. Habit page:
    1. Try to create or edit a habit with an empty field and verify that an error message about missing fields would appear

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
